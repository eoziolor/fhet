decided to just go ahead and map all the reads to the chromosome ordered genome
downloaded genome from Jeff today. Moved it to the kodiak cluster
mapping everything to that with mapping.sh placed in scripts2/
	split into 8 scripts for speed

indexing genome with bwa index $genome
creating fai with samtools fai $genome

9-18-17

removed empty reads with
find /directory/to/reads/ -size 0 -print0 | xargs -0 rm
find /directory/to/reads/ -size -93 -print0 | xargs -0 rm

re-mapped 50-101 due to typo in script

found out that program for fst callign was crashing due to 2 arguments being part of the GL call, but it needs 3
re-done vcf has three arguments for GL, so as soon as mapping is done, I will re-call vcf on chromosomal alignment and run from there!

copied scripts bammerge,coverage,hicov.sh to scripts2

I will execute them in order to get hicov regions to exclude before calling variants.

used the following line to create a genome file in the /genome2/ subfolder
awk -v OFS='\t' {'print $1,$2'} $fai > $genome

started using coverage.sh (scripts2) folder to get per base samtools derived coverage to get windows to exclude from calling vcf

9-20-17

ran hicov_bed.sh script to exclude regions of high coverage (above 300).
	4th column is now how many bases are in the excluded region (can be used to see how much of the genome was excluded).

started calling variants on the chromosome ordered genome.

I am trying to run freebayes in parallel in order to get a better run time. Not in parallel it should take 10 days....

SNeP seems to be an interesting tool to figure out effective population sizes (use it after vcf is called)

realized i didn't index the merged bam file...which is why this could potentially be taking this long...
samtools index on .bam file - trying out parallel again.
Yep, parallel works...ran freebayes-parallel_chr[1-4].sh broke it down to scaffold length chunks and ran it that way. RIDDICK

created keep files using the old keep scripts (indexed them with angsd)

re-did all the lists and re-ran freebayes-parallel with new list of pops (i don't think it really matters, but I did it just in case)
	old lists had the old bam destinations, but those are only used for sample name and not for actual destination.
