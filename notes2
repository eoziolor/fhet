decided to just go ahead and map all the reads to the chromosome ordered genome
downloaded genome from Jeff today. Moved it to the kodiak cluster
mapping everything to that with mapping.sh placed in scripts2/
	split into 8 scripts for speed

indexing genome with bwa index $genome
creating fai with samtools fai $genome

removed empty reads with
find /directory/to/reads/ -size 0 -print0 | xargs -0 rm
find /directory/to/reads/ -size -93 -print0 | xargs -0 rm

re-mapped 50-101 due to typo in script

found out that program for fst callign was crashing due to 2 arguments being part of the GL call, but it needs 3
re-done vcf has three arguments for GL, so as soon as mapping is done, I will re-call vcf on chromosomal alignment and run from there!

copied scripts bammerge,coverage,hicov.sh to scripts2

I will execute them in order to get hicov regions to exclude before calling variants.
