	-> Done reading data from chromosome will prepare next chromosome
	-> Only read nSites: 0 will therefore prepare next chromosome (or exit)

	-> NB NB output is no longer log probs of the frequency spectrum!
	-> Output is now simply the expected values! 
	-> You can convert to the old format simply with log(norm(x))
