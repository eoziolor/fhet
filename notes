downloaded funhe genome version 3.0.2 from:
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/000/826/765/GCF_000826765.1_Fundulus_heteroclitus-3.0.2/
downloaded same version gff file from same repository

3/31/17
moved funhe genome and annotation to kodiak folder:
/data/oziolore/fhet/data/genome

unzipped using:
gzip -d reference_funhe.fna.gz > reference_funhe.fna

indexed using:
/data/oziolore/programs/bwa/bwa index reference_funhe.fna

Moved raw reads from stationary computer to cluster using rsync -a (i think, lost actual script)

4/3/17
Mapped reads to heteroclitus genome using script mapping.sh found in
/data/oziolore/fhet/scirpts/mapping.sh
parsed it into 4 scirpts to run faster

fai indexed the fhet genome file using:
/data/oziolore/upload/samtools-1.3/samtools faidx \
/data/oziolore/fhet/data/genome/reference_funhe.fna

Used awk to turn fai to a genome file:
awk -v OFS='\t' {'print $1,$2'} /data/oziolore/fhet/data/genome/reference_funhe.fna.fai >/data/oziolore/fhet/data/genome/reference_funhe_genome.txt

created list of each population using old lists from FG comparison and placed them in:
/data/oziolore/fhet/data/list/

ran coverage stats on populations using:
/data/oziolore/fhet/scripts/cover.sh

4/7/17

Made a sub-genome file by using cat reference_funhe_genome.txt | grep NW_012234471.1 > reference_ahr_genome.txt

Made smaller windowed files just for ahr using 50b10b_winahr.sh (CHANGED SCRIPT TO FULL GENOME) in scripts folder

modified cover.sh and ran just for the scaffold that holds AHR and 50b10bslide
	ran it as cover_ahr_50b.sh
	did not work with this as apparently I have to create bams just for the region that I am interested in if I want to do that
	I will suck it up and just do coverage on that tiny window for all
	for that I will have to expand the 50b10b.bed to the full genome
ran this using cover_50b.sh

estimated allele frequencies of ahr deletion:
	used median coverage
	running script in R and estimating coverage of bb/(gb+sp/2) over the first 600000 bases of the scaffold of ahr
	then estimated over the deletion region 640000:700000 roughly
	divided coverage of bb in deletion region over average to see % individuals with the ahr allele in  resistant BB pop
	calculated allele frequency and propagated error. all found in coverage.r in ~/share/fhe/coverage

made subfile of only the AHR carrying scaffold using:
	cat $pop.50b10b.qf.cov | grep NW_012234474.1 > $pop.50b10b.subashr.cov
